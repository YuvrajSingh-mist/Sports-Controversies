            \textbf{Event} & \textbf{Favor} & \textbf{Against} & \textbf{Neutral} \\
            \hline
            \multirow{3}{*}{\textit{Frank Lampard Ghost Goal}} 
            & 1. Germans can't say anything about unsporting behavior.  & 1. The 1966 ghost goal had to be paid for. & 1. This was way more clear-cut than 1966. \\
            & 2. What a disgrace this Manuel is.  & 2. Payback for the 1966 final & 2. Inconclusive! Just couldn’t get a good angle. \\
            & 3. Could have been one of the greatest games.  & 3. Even Geoff Hurst said his goal didn’t count. & 3. I remember this game. \\
            \hline
            \multirow{3}{*}{\textit{Luis Suárez Handball}} 
            & 1. Morality always loses, and nice guys finish last.  & 1. Suárez cost Ghana the World Cup semi-final. & 1. He will never step foot in Ghana. \\
            & 2. I just love Luis Suarez with all his behaviors I don't know why.  & 2. This man was often mentally unstable. & 2. That was back then, now there’s goal-line technology. \\
            & 3. By apologizing, he would look stupid. & 3. Hand of Satan. & 3. It’s part of the game. \\
            \hline
            \multirow{3}{*}{\textit{Maradona Hand of God}} 
            & 1. Yup. Goalies s*cked these days. & 1. Errrrr! Hand of god? Cheater. & 1. When the football was football. \\
            & 2. The Real OG of all times. & 2. He makes the opponent look so stupid and clumsy. & 2. Back in the day nobody could play football, that's why he appeared to be that good. \\
            & 3. Number 15 goal is something else...my favourite. Bravo. & 3. The most cheating player in football history. & 3. You will never be able to pick one between Maradona and Messi. \\
            \hline
            \multirow{3}{*}{\textit{Jonny Bairstow Run-Out}} 
            & 1. That's not cheating, that's the way of winning.  & 1. Same old Aussies, always cheating. & 1. The lesson for the players is "pay attention." \\
            & 2. They gave Jonny ample time to stop walking out of his crease, so fair game! & 2. Australia cheating again. Who could have seen that coming? & 2. Growing up in Australia, we were taught to throw the ball at the batters' head if they left their crease like this. \\
            & 3. Jonny was too quick to get out of the crease, so it is totally a fair decision. & 3. Not cheating, just bad sportsmanship. & 3. This is just pure drama and I love it. \\
            \hline
            \multirow{3}{*}{\textit{Ashwin Mankadding}} 
            & 1. If a bowler can keep his foot inside the crease, a batsman can wait with the bat inside the crease until the ball is bowled. What's wrong with that? & 1. If you Mankadding, you should be ashamed of yourself. & 1. Ashwin merely expressed his disappointment but never wanted a wicket that way. \\
            & 2. This is out according to the rule. & 2. Not a fair runout considering sportsmanship and the spirit of the game. & 2. Whenever a batsman leaves the crease, he gets 1 to 2 ft benefits in running. \\
            & 3. Great presence of mind... genius of the game. & 3. This rule is absurd. How can you be allowed to run out someone without delivering the ball? & 3. Batters don’t do it on purpose; they walk out expecting the bowler to deliver the ball. \\
            \hline
            \multirow{3}{*}{\textit{The Underarm Incident}} 
            & 1. That time, it was legal to bowl underarm according to the rules. & 1. That was against the spirit of the game! Couldn't they just bowl a normal delivery? & 1. What were the exact rules for underarm deliveries back then? \\
            & 2. The bottom line is that there was nothing in the rules at the time saying you can't bowl underarm, so technically, nothing wrong was done. & 2. The greatest cowards in the world... None other than the Aussies. & 2. Carrying on about something decades later as if it's relevant today is the real injustice. \\
            & 3. Well, if they were allowed to do it, then fair play to them. & 3. Poor sportsmanship. & 3. Greatest highlight in cricket history, great footage. \\
